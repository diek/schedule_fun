Here several options for deploying django
I am sure the experts here have their own recipes for deploying django. Daniel Greenfeld tells me that the most common approach is to use nginx + uwsgi. But like anything there are various approaches to deployment. Here are several. I will add a windows version when I find a good one. I have no experience with windows. I use ubuntu for my servers, but that is just me. I like it because when something goes wrong I can almost always find the answer myself or easily get help. If you go to the Digital Ocean site, web hosting or Linode, They have all kinds of tutorials on creating a server using ubuntu, debian, linux and other distros, With nginx or apache and django.
